### Longer-Term View (Last Year)
Over the past year, the stock displayed volatility with a mix of bullish and bearish phases. The broader trend had been slightly bearish over the span, reflecting challenges potentially accentuated by broader economic conditions and sector-specific pressures:

- **Support Levels**: Stronger support is reaffirmed around $52.00, providing a cushion that has held on several occasions throughout the year, suggesting this as a solid strategic buying area.
- **Resistance Levels**: Major resistance lies near the $60.00 mark, a level tested several times but not convincingly breached this year.
- **Pattern Analysis**: A descending channel appears to be forming, indicating the potential for a continuation of downward pressure unless there is a breakout with strong volume above the upper boundary.

### Potential Entry Points
- **Conservative Entry**: Enter positions when the price is near the identified long-term support at $52.00, with a tight stop-loss just below this level to mitigate risk.
- **Aggressive Entry**: Consider positions on a confirmed breakout above the $55.00 mark, provided it's supported by strong volume, to capitalize on potential upward momentum.

### Price Targets
- **Short-Term Target**: If upward momentum confirms, the target would be $58.00, representing the recent high and previous resistance level.
- **Long-Term Target**: A move towards $60.00 would be a significant achievement, hinting at a potential trend reversal.
